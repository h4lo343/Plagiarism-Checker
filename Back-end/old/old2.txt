From its earliest discovery by non-indigenous people in the 
mid-nineteenth century, Yosemite Valley has held a spiritual hold  
on the American conscience; its beauty is incomparable and has 
been held up as one of the grandest of all special temples 
of nature. While Yosemite has a special grip on the western 
mind, impressions about the Valley hav evolved over time, 
shaped by changing politics, migration patterns and environmental 
concerns as mankind has become more attuned to its relationship 
and impact on nature.
