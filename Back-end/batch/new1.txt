We aim to 

provide an easy-to-use tool for teachers to avoid wasting time and human resources on such tedious yet necessary tasks and therefore help to maintain a healthy and rigorous academic environment
raise the consciousness of the importance of academic integrity among students


Problems
CS assignments can be in either code or text format, so we need at least two different sets of duplication detection algorithms.
Some schools do not have a high-quality LMS(Learning Management System), and students must submit their work on paper. Therefore we need to integrate OCR(Optical Character Recognition) technology to support formats such as jpg.
